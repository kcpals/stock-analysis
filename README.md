# Green Stocks Analysis

## Project Overview
Client, Steve, is looking for analysis various green energy stocks to diversify his clients portfolio.  Green Energy is a passion of said clients and there are numerous forms of energy to invest in.  Today, the client has invested solely in DAQO New Energy Corp(DQ), that makes silicon wafers for solar panels.  Steve is concerned his clients have put all of their money into one stock and wants to suggest they diversify by investing in other green energy companies.  Steve has identified twielve other green companies that could be potential investments but needs further analytics on the health of the companies before he can suggest to his clients.

## Results
Steve was interested in finding total daily volume and yearly return for each stock.  Since Steve's clients have invest only in Daqo, we started with an analysis of Daq only. We discovered that the stock is traded often, 107,873,900 times in 2018.  Steve's clients believe if a stock is traded often then the price will accurately reflect the value of the stock

Based on some of the data, it appears Daqo may not be the best stock for sole investment.  We wanted to analyze multiple stocks to find better choices for Steve's clients.
