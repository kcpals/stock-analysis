# Green Stocks Analysis

## Project Overview
Client, Steve, is looking for analysis various green energy stocks to diversify his clients portfolio.  Green Energy is a passion of said clients and there are numerous forms of energy to invest in.  Today, the client has invested solely in DAQO New Energy Corp(DQ), that makes silicon wafers for solar panels.  Steve is concerned his clients have put all of their money into one stock and wants to suggest they diversify by investing in other green energy companies.  Steve has identified twielve other green companies that could be potential investments but needs further analytics on the health of the companies before he can suggest to his clients.

# Starting Analysis
Steve was interested in finding total daily volume and yearly return for each stock.  Since Steve's clients have invest only in Daqo, we started with an analysis of Daq only.
